    <h1>What It’s Like to Be 12 in 2025</h1>

    <p>
      Being 12 in 2025 is like living in two different worlds — one online and one in real life.
      We have school, friends, family, and a lot of pressure, but we also have games, TikTok,
      and cool tech. Some days feel amazing, and other days feel a little confusing.

      One thing I’ve learned is that it’s okay to be different. Everyone is figuring things out.
      Whether you're into sports, art, gaming, or just chilling with music — it all matters.

      Growing up in this generation is fast, fun, and sometimes, definitely frustrating  — but I think that’s what makes it some what exciting.
